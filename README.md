Codes of my PhD Thesis

Dear All,

This repository is meant to provide all codes of my PhD thesis - Limit Order Book Resilience and Cross Impact Limit Order Book Model. The thesis is available at the following link:

http://webcat.warwick.ac.uk/record=b2754878~S1

However, currently I have just published the codes of chapter 3.

We should run two Matlab functions, one function in each subfolder of Chapter 3, in order to generate the results of this chapter. They are ‘crossimpactCost.m’ in the subfolder 'cross impact LOB model' and ‘zerospreadCost.m’ in the subfolder 'zero spread LOB model', corresponding to my cross impact LOB model and the Alfonsi’s zero spread LOB model presented in 2013. All other function will be called by these two functions.

All commitments to my project are welcomed. I will upload the codes of other chapter in the near future.

Xin Geng
